## CustomToken Smart Contract
The CustomToken smart contract is an implementation of the ERC-20 token standard on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to create, transfer, and burn tokens in a decentralized manner.

Contract Details
Token Name: CustomToken
Token Symbol: CTK
Functionality
Mint Tokens
The mintTokens function allows users to mint new tokens and add them to their account balance.

### account: The Ethereum address to which the minted tokens will be added.
### amount: The number of tokens to mint and add to the account balance.
## Burn Tokens
The burnTokens function allows users to burn (destroy) a specified number of tokens from their account balance.


### account: The Ethereum address from which tokens will be burned.
### amount: The number of tokens to burn from the account balance.
## Usage
Deploy the CustomToken contract on the Ethereum blockchain using a compatible development environment or platform.
Interact with the contract through the functions described above using Ethereum addresses and token amounts as inputs.
## Considerations
This is a basic example and lacks advanced features for a production-ready token contract, such as access control and event emitting.
Always ensure to test the contract thoroughly on testnets before deploying to the mainnet.
Security is paramount; make sure to follow best practices for smart contract development to prevent vulnerabilities.
